<p>Please remember that 1200 calories per day may not satisfy your specific dietary needs. I am not a doctor, nutrionist, or dietitian. I'm just a normal gal on the weightloss journey since forever who wanted to share some of my meal plans, favourite foods, tricks, tips and weekly menus to help inspire you and hopefully help you stay on target.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Menus &amp; mealplans</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkVMGNBvAn01safbozKIawOTnaFQY-zPru6ACcVfliA/edit?usp=sharing">menu template</a> is based on the Mincavi model, a weight loss program in Quebec that works similarly to Weight watchers points. These specific templates include a section for you to add the estimated calories for each meal. The different food groups listed, both per day and in the weekly-protein section are used as inspiration to keep a wide variety of food rather than a hard-and-fast rule about what you should be eating. It's an omnivore template, though there's no red meat listed.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inspired by /r/1200isplenty and /r/loseit</h3>

<p>Inspired by the awesome reddit communities of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/">/r/1200isplenty</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/">/r/loseit</a>, I wanted to create a place where people could find resources and inspiration. If you stumbled upon this site from somewhere other than reddit, I encourage you to visit those forms and be active and helpful. They have lots of great resources and a very friendly, very welcoming community.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>I've been trying to lose weight since forever. I even succeeded twice, though I gained the weight back within a year of reaching a normal BMI. This project is as much about holding myself accountable as it is about learning how to use Github and start a personal project from scratch. The bonus is that, hopefully, I'll be giving people ideas by being transparent about my weight loss journey. The blog that will be the biggest source of content will talk about food, travel, and be my creative outlet for my writing. I expect to post bi-monthly. Thanks for joining me for the ride.</p>
